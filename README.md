## DALIGA
MATLAB implementation of the paper "Direct affinity learning to boost multi-view clustering via subspace merging on a Grassmann manifold".

The main method is ``method.m``.

run ``run_syn.m``, ``run_3s.m``, ``run_bbc.m``, ``run_Caltech.m``, ``run_UCI.m`` to get experimental results on synthetic, 3-sources, BBCSport, Caltech 101, UCI Digit dataset, respectively.
